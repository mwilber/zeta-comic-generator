<p class="description">
    Zeta Comic Generator starts with a premise, a short description of what the comic should be about. 
    Large Language Models at <a href="https://openai.com/product" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI</a> 
    use the premise to write a complete script for a three panel comic strip. 
    The model then elaborates on a scene description for each panel. 
    That description is sent to the <a href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dall-E</a> 
    image generator to render a background image. 
    Finally the model selects from a list of <a href="/about#character-art">character actions</a>, each one representing an image of 
    <a href="https://greenzeta.com/project/illustrations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alpha Zeta</a>, 
    the alien mascot of <a href="https://greenzeta.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GreenZeta.com</a>. 
    All of the assets are combined here into a single comic strip!

		<h3>Script</h3>
		<div class="codeblock">
			<code>
                You are a cartoonist and humorist. Write the script for a three panel comic strip.
                <br/>
                In the comic strip our main character, a short green humaniod alien named Alpha Zeta, engages in the following premise: 
                <br/>
                {Premise}
                <br/>
                Include a detailed scene description and words spoken by the main character.
                <br/>
                Write your script in the form of a json object. The json object has the following properties: `title` and `panels`.
                <br/>
                The following is a description of each property value:
                <br/>
                `title`: The title of the comic strip. Limit to 50 letters.
                <br/>
                `panels` is an array of objects with the following properties: `scene` and `dialog`
                <br/>
                `scene`: A description of the panel scene including all characters.
                <br/>
                `dialog`: Words spoken by Alpha Zeta. He is the only character that speaks so there is no need to label with a name. This can be an empty string if the character is not speaking.",
			</code>

	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Backgrounds</h3>
		<div class="codeblock">
			<code>
                You are a talented artist who draws background art for animated cartoons.
                <br/>
                Write Dall-E prompts to draw backgrounds for three animation cells. These animation cells depict our main character, Alpha Zeta, in a scene.
                <br/>
                Descriptions of the three scenes are as follows:
                <br/>
				- {Scene from panel 1 of the script}
				<br/>
				- {Scene from panel 2 of the script}
				<br/>
				- {Scene from panel 3 of the script}
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Your Dall-E prompts will be written within the following rules:
				<br/>
				- Describe each scene as it would look if the main character, Alpha Zeta, is not present.
				<br/>
				- No characters will speak to each other.
				<br/>
				- Do not include any items that contain readable text.
				<br/>
				- Do not reference a comic strip panel.
				<br/>
				Write the prompts as a json object with a single property `descriptions`, which is an array of strings containing each of the prompts.
                <br/>
			</code>
		</div>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Character Actions</h3>
		<div class="codeblock">
			<code>
				The following statements describe a three part story.
				<br/>
				- {Scene from panel 1 of the script}
				<br/>
				- {Scene from panel 2 of the script}
				<br/>
				- {Scene from panel 3 of the script}
				<br/>
				For each of the three parts coose one word from the following which most closely describes the action of the main character:
				angry, approval, explaining, ...
				<br/>
				Write your response as a valid json object with a single property `panels`, which is an array of strings containing each of the chosen words.
