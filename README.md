## The Process

Write a sentence or two describing a premise for the comic strip. ChatGPT takes the premise and writes a three panel comic strip describing: dialog, background scenery, and character action. The text description of the background scenery is sent to the Dall-E image generator to produce background images. The character action is selected from a list of pre-drawn character art featuring [Alpha Zeta](https://greenzeta.com/project/illustrations/), the alien mascot of [GreenZeta.com](https://greenzeta.com). All of these assets are merged together into a comic strip!
